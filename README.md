# G03_Assignment2

This is a scrollytelling project to convey sustainability problems about Goal 13 - Climate Action in more detail. 

The project is useful to convey very important information in a different way. Making the facts and the importance into a story will hopefully be more appealing to both learn and help.  

If users want to get started with the project themselves, go to https://sdgs.un.org/goals to find a goal that they find interesting and important. Then if you do not know what scrollytelling is, google that to get inspirations for your project - like this: https://webflow.com/blog/scrollytelling-guide and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

If users need help there are multiple platforms available to ask questions and look for information - like https://stackoverflow.com/

The technology that is used on this project is html, css and javascript.

The person who maintains and contributes to this project is Eva Fossen Haugum.
